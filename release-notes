2. Previous changes to support PM  merged
3. This version not to be used with postProc (updates to follow)

postProc changes:
Aparna Radhakrishnan
1. Ability to post post-process two fields at a time (e.g. tasmin, tasmin_qcmask)
2. BasicChecker before post post-processing begins (this is coded in a way it can be a potential generic stand-alone tool) 
      -- Quits if there are extraneous files in OneD directory
      -- Quits if there are extraneous files in twoD catted directory
      -- Quits if the total number of minifiles does not match the expected number (lon range)
      -- Quits if atleast one of the files in the OneD or existing twoD directory is Zero bytes. 
    
3. Color coding Error messages.
4. Fix predictand_calibration_dataset global attribute (item from QC results from ESD call 11/12/14)----- removed if the variable is a mask. 

expergen changes: 
Aparna Radhakrishnan
1. Changes to use <ifprefixexist>tags for anti-clobber feature.
   -- If  <ifprefixexist> has exit: if either OneD output OR scripts already exist, expergen throws errors and exits.
   -- If  <ifprefixexist> has erase:  if either OneD output OR scripts already exist, expergen throws warning messages, then executes the external cleaner/scrubber script (from cew). After this expergen continues it's regular workflow of creating runscripts, etc. 
   --- If platform is anything other than PAN, expergen quits with an error at this time. 
   --- Errors/warnings color coding
2. "automatic msub" option added to expergen. This is a command-line option --msub. When you pass --msub to expergen, expergen not only creates master runscripts for you, but also submits them to MOAB automatically. By default, this is turned off. One can always opt to use the existing submit_job script to submit jobs as well.

2/6/2014: 
-- if <ifpreexist> has move: If either OneD output or scripts already exist, expergen throws warning and moves the old outout to a new directory
-- BCQM and EDQM methods now sort quantile output by the order of the values in the future_predictor (coarse future, CF) dataset
-- Support for non-SCSC0p1 grids
-- Modified directory structure for input and output datasets
- Downscaled region added to directory structure
-- spatial and temporal dimension data and metadata obtained from input files rather than the mask files
-- Now possible to run all parts of the workflow without needing to specify a spatial or temporal mask
-- Expergen writes a command file that can be sourced to run postProc


Regression test changes:
